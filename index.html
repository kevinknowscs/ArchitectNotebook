                  <p>This notebook is dedicated to software architecural principles.</p>
                  <p>
                    Let us consider three primary aspects of software development:
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Computer Science</strong> - Here I refer to the underlying principles
                      and theories of computer science, namely, data structures, algorithms, space
                      and runtime complexities of potential solutions, time/space tradeoffs, problem
                      decomposition, number theory, parsing theory, etc.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Software Engineering</strong> - When I think of software engineering, I think
                      mainly of applying processes and practices that are necessary to produce practical
                      real-world applications that can be shipped to customers. This would include the craft
                      of writing clean, readable, maintainable code, as well as peripheral activities such
                      as quality assurance and project management, agile practices, etc.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Software Architecture</strong> - By &quot;architecture&quot; I refer more to the
                      bigger picture of system design; not so much low-level algorithmic details, but the bigger
                      picture of how a large problem is decomposed into workable subsystem. A very good starting
                      point for software architecture is to understand common design patterns that can be reused
                      across solutions. We also consider major architectural genres such as object-oriented design
                      and functional programming.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    This notebook is dedicated to the later discipline - software architecture.
